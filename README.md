# hello-world
1st repository

Hi there,

My name is Third. I'm new to coding world and just jumping into git hub. The only experience I have as of this commit i:basic SQL 
and Python from Datacamp, and some basic SQL usage in a previous job. I want to develop my skills and maybe switch professions into a 
new field. I find coding and learning about it very intersting and something that I think is worth pursuing for both my own growth, 
as well as a valuable skill for the future.
